\section{Exercises of Chapter 2}

\begin{enumerate}

	\item {\bf Discuss the dichotomy of rocket science in the modern era.}\\
	
	\item {\bf In your own words give a definition for a rocket mission.}\\
	
	\item {\bf What is a payload?}\\
	
	\item {\bf What is the so-called “SMAD”?}\\
	
	\item {\bf Give the four basic assumptions required for understanding the basics of projectile motion.}\\
	
	\item {\bf Define MECO.}\\
	
	\item {\bf Equation 2.9 gives the parabolic flight path of a rocket trajectory as height, \textit{y}, as a function of range, \textit{x}, or \textit{y(x)}. Use the quadratic equation to solve for x as a function of y to give a range equation as a function of height.}\\
	
	\item {\bf A rocket is launched with a burnout velocity of 75 m/sec, burnout altitude of 300 m, and a burnout range of 100 m. Assuming a flight path angle of 75\degree, calculate the final range of the rocket when it impacts the ground.}\\
	
	\item {\bf Calculate the maximum altitude reached by the rocket in Exercise 8.}\\

	\item {\bf Redo Exercise 8 to determine the range at MECO altitude. What is the range at MECO if the initial flight path angle is 15\degree ?}\\
